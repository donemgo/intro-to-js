//in javascript the way we store values are using variables, it is either we declare it immediately or we declare the variable and go below and assign it

// Naming conventions, you have to sabi how to name javascipt variables. injavascript we name variables using camelcase, that is they must start with $ or _
// they must not contain special symbols % # !

// another very important thing you have to know is that javascript has some reserved key words e,g let, this, case, with and so others. dont worry it is not plenty

//STRINGS
let name = 'your name between these quotes';

//NUMBERS these are numbers in javascript, with or without decimal
let amount = 10000;
let pi = 3.14;

// Boolean
let areYouHivPositive = false;

//NULL

let howMuch = null;

// now we can use a special javascript function call "typeof" to find out the type of  variable we have

typeof amount;
