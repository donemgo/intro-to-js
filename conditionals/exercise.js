// let us write a conditional statement that checks if the number we put in a prompt message is less than 10, or less than 100. if it is more than or equal to 100 then we do something else

//conditions < 10 ----> console.log('this number is small');
//conditions < 100 ----> console.log('this number is medium');
//conditions >= 100 ----> console.log('this number is large');

// for the second execise write a program that calculates the value of 2^10;

// let result = 1;
// let counter = 0;
// while (counter < 10) {
//   result = result * 2;
//   counter = counter + 1;
// }
