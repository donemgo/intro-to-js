// create two lists with one containing your favourite cars and the other containing your favorite fruits e.g ['lamborgini', 'toyota'], create your own function called printList and call this function on those lists.

// next modify your function to run a check on the number of items in your list, if the items are less than two it should return 'not enough items', it has more it should go ahead and print all the fruits.

// this one might be a bit tricky :) :). create a function called concateListsFunc, this function would take in two arrays and mix them into one, meaning it would concatenate them.

// so it would look something like this concateListsFunc([1,2,4], [1,b,c]) => [1,2,4,1,b,c]
