// the operators we have have in JS are going to be familiar to you
// + - * / %

const five = 2 + 3;
// we have two special kinds of operators, ++ -- . these operators increments and decrements values respectively.

let x = 5;
x = x + 1;
// or
x++;

//variables can also store the value of expressions, e.g 4 * 6 is an expression,  which is noce because we can reuse the results of these expressions for later without repeating ourselves

const multiplyNums = 4 * 6;

// COMPARISONS
// sometimes we want to compare two values, Javascript gives us a way to do this by using comparators

// EQUAL(not strict) == e.g 5 == '5'
// EQUAL(strict) === equal in value and type e.g 5 === 5
// NOT EQUAL(not struct) !=
// NOT EQUAL(strict) !==
//  > < <= >= you suppose know these ones
