// the operators we have have in JS are going to be familiar to you
// + - * / %

const five = 2 + 3;
// we have two special kinds of operators, ++ -- . these operators increments and decrements values respectively.

let x = 5;
x = x + 1;
// or
x++;

//variables can also store the value of expressions, e.g 4 * 6 is an expression,  which is noce because we can reuse the results of these expressions for later without repeating ourselves
