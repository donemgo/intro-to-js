// now we have learnt about variables, it is time for us to talk about data structures, and the first one we would talk about is ARRAYS
// Arrays are a list of square brackets, and they are written with square brackets []

const movies = ['star wars', 'true lies', 'games of thrones', 'mission impossible'];
// array access is zero based. to access the first element we use the name of the array with a square bracket with zero inside.
const firstItem = movies[0];

// arrays offers us several sweet capabilities, we would start by looking at the three most common ones

// push(), pop(), length, shift, unshift
